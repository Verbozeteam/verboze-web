The guest will remember the bad experience which will overshadow all other positive experiences in the hotel. For that reason we built a system with sensors that preemptively informs the staff about any malfunctions as soon as they occur."}</p>

The rerouting is all done in a central spot in your room (the electrical distribution board) and it requires no breaking walls, pulling wires or making any heavy changes to your room. The sensors in the system analyze and monitor the state of your room, using our machine learning algorithm, not only can we detect faults in your room, but also predict them ahead of time."}</p>
