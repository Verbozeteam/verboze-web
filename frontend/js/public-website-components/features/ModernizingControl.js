                        The Verboze system is installed in each of your hotel rooms allowing them to be automated and easily controlled. The system supports automating the following components:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lights and Dimmers</li>
                        <li>Motorized Curtains</li>
                        <li>Air Conditioner</li>
                        <li>TV and Entertainment</li>
                        <li>Locking/Unlocking of the Door</li>
                        <li>Digital Room Service and Do Not Disturb Lights (outside the room)</li>
                        <li>And more...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All components can be easily accessed and controlled by the hotel staff and more importantly the guests.

                        The primary control device that is installed in every room is a touchscreen that we provide, either portable or mounted on a wall. You may choose to have several touchscreen devices for different arrangements of your rooms or suites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Guests will have access to an app on their own smartphones which can connect to their booked rooms and give them control of the room for the duration of their stay.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Voice assistants can be installed in the rooms to enable voice-activated commands to control the room.
